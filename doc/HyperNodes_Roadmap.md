The Hypernodes will be deployed over several phases. Keep in mind all is from scratch and we need real world feedback to improve and fully activate the PoS layer.

## Beta phase

Estimate: second half of August

- First code release.
- Hypernodes registration
- Field testing
- hosting requirements adjustments
- Testing of the reward mechanism
- No reward yet

## All seeing eye

- KPIs recording
- rewards activation

## Enforcement

- KPIs exploitation
- First lists to be used
- Feedback on the collected data and projected use.

## Retro-action

Several steps of retroaction and improvement:  
- manual selection of KPIs to filter actors and secure the net, 
- define the right KPIs sets.

## Governance

Final version, stable Hypernodes code, parameters are governance variables.
